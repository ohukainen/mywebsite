        <p><strong>Joke 1:</strong> Why don't scientists trust atoms? <br><em>Because they make up everything!</em></p>
        <p><strong>Joke 2:</strong> What do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire? <br><em>Frostbite.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Joke 3:</strong> Why did the math book look sad? <br><em>Because it had too many problems.</em></p>
