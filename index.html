    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage!</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Johannes, and I am currently learning the basics of web development. This page will hopefully grow into something that I can be proud of, but this is all I have for now.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="info">
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> Pursuing a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering (5th/last year) at Linköping University in Sweden.</p>
        <p><strong>My Career:</strong> I currently work part-time as a C++ junior backend developer.</p>
        <p><strong>Interests:</strong> During my free time, I enjoy disc golf, hiking, and classic literature.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I hope you look forward to this page growing. In the future, I want to expand it to include some of my favorite projects, a contact page, and a book recommendation page!</p>
